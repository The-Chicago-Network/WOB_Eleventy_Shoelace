bio: Gayla Brockman moved to Chicago in 2016 to become the third President and CEO of the Michael Reese Health Trust. In just two years she orchestrated the transition of Michael Reese into a publicly supported foundation. As a public foundation, Michael Reese is able to leverage its assets, knowledge of industry and community and relationships to create the best possible environment for community based organizations and their programs. Whether it be creating a risk-free laboratory in which to prove concepts, incubating efforts that have proven successful in other communities or helping to accelerate promising practices, funders have a role to play to support the success of organizations and programs that align with mission. Previously, Ms. Brockman served as the Executive Director of the Menorah Legacy Foundation, a health care funder and program incubator, in Kansas City, Missouri from 2003 to 2015. Gayla is a co-founder of the Kansas City Double Up Food Bucks Kansas City, which makes fresh, locally grown food accessible and affordable to low-income residents. Prior to her foundation work, Ms. Brockman lived in Boston and worked in employee health at Bostonâ€™s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Tufts Health Plan. She has a BA degree from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI and a MS degree in Health Care Administration from Simmons College in Boston, MA. Gayla is a member of The Chicago Network, a mentor for the Jewish Federation and Chicago Women in Philanthropy, a volunteer on the Equal Hope Strategic Planning Committee and a member of the Chicago History Museum. Ms. Brockman is married, has one daughter who is a sommelier working for Villa Maria Estate, the largest winery in New Zealand, and has a golden retriever named Cooper. Ms. Brockman practices yoga, runs and plays tennis.<br /><br />Accomplished, high energy, innovative health care foundation executive. I believe foundations should leverage their assets, knowledge of industry, community and relationships to create the best possible environment for community based organizations and their programs. Whether it be creating a risk-free laboratory in which to prove concepts, incubating efforts that have proven successful in other communities or helping to accelerate promising practices, funders have a role to play to support the success of organizations and programs that align with mission.
