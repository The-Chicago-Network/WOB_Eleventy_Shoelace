currentOrg: Invitation Homes, Inc., The Boler Company, Henley Consulting LLC
bio: Jana Barbe is an experienced, effective, and highly regarded director of
  both public and private companies. She possesses a keen and perceptive
  understanding of boardroom dynamics, a strong background in governance and a
  sophisticated business acumen grounded in real estate and capital markets,
  built on a foundation in the global professional services industry.<br /><br
  />Jana serves on the Board of Directors of Invitation Homes, Inc. (NYSE&#58;
  INVH), an S&amp;P 500 company and the nation’s premier single-family home
  leasing and management company. She joined the Board shortly after Invitation
  Homes completed its IPO and its transformative merger with Starwood Waypoint
  Homes (NYSE&#58; SFR). <br /><br />A long-time member of the audit committee,
  Jana is well-versed in risk management oversight, financial reporting, and
  cybersecurity. Jana has earned the CERT Certificate in Cybersecurity Oversight
  from the CERT Division of the Software Engineering Institute at Carnegie
  Mellon University and the National Association of Corporate Directors. Jana
  also serves as a member of the Nominating and Governance Committee of
  Invitation Homes and served for several years on the Compensation Committee.
  Given her breadth of Company knowledge as well as her market acuity, she is
  regularly called upon to engage directly with institutional investors
  regarding such matters as “say on pay”, talent management and
  sustainability.<br /><br />Jana also serves as an independent director of The
  Boler Company. The Boler Company is a family office and the owner of
  Hendrickson International, the leading global producer of medium and
  heavy-duty truck and trailer suspensions and related components for the
  commercial transportation industry. With its world-wide footprint, Hendrickson
  is a primary supplier to every North American heavy-duty truck and trailer
  manufacturer, and to most manufacturers in Europe, Australia, South America,
  and Asia. <br /><br />Perhaps Jana is best known though as a preeminent
  authority on affordable housing and community development. Most recently, Jana
  served as a Senior Advisor to Blackstone and to its portfolio company, April
  Housing, in connection with the launch of the Blackstone and April Housing
  affordable housing businesses. Jana has now transitioned to the role of
  external consultant providing strategic and substantive advice to Blackstone
  and April Housing on the creation and preservation of affordable housing.<br
  /><br />Before joining Blackstone, Jana was a partner at Dentons, the largest
  law firm in the world, where she founded its nationally renowned affordable
  housing and community development practice and served in senior management.
  Jana was one of a small group of five leaders who transformed what was
  Sonnenschein Nath &amp; Rosenthal, a 650-person Midwest-centric law firm, into
  Dentons with more than 10,000 lawyers and an unprecedented presence in over 80
  countries, and she did so while shattering glass ceilings. Jana was the first
  woman appointed to the Dentons’ Global Board where she served as the only
  woman for six years, and the first Global Vice Chair appointed from the U.S.
  region. She traveled the world establishing and supporting geographically and
  culturally diverse offices. As such, Jana effectuated groundbreaking and
  lasting change for women in the legal profession, as recognized by Corporate
  Counsel and InsideCounsel magazines when they awarded her the 2019 Women,
  Influence &amp; Power Lifetime Achievement Award. In 2017, Jana was also
  presented with Linkage’s Women in Leadership Executive Impact Award.<br /><br
  />Equally committed to serving her local community. Jana is a past Chairperson
  of the Board of Thresholds, Illinois' oldest and largest provider of
  supportive services and housing for individuals with severe and persistent
  mental illnesses. <br /><br />Jana is a graduate of The University of Chicago
  Law School and Northwestern University where she majored in Art History and
  graduated with honors.
