bio: A visionary, principled executive, Maria Wynne has an impressive history of
  leading organizations to new heights of financial performance and operational
  excellence and fearlessly heads large-scale business turnarounds,
  organizational restructures, and complex mergers. With deep expertise spanning
  the public, private, and nonprofit sectors, she guides companies from a solid
  strategic foundation to superior execution and leverages technology to advance
  business priorities and sustain a competitive edge as both a corporate
  executive and independent board director.<br /><br />Maria currently serves on
  Federal Home Loan Bank of Chicago’s board as well as both board member and
  membership committee chair of the National Association of Corporate Directors’
  Chicago chapter. <br /><br />Most recently, Maria led a top-to-bottom
  transformation as CEO of Leadership Greater Chicago shepherding this premier
  civic organization to the most prosperous period in its 40-year history. She
  headed strategic planning and implementation and reimagined the governance
  model while increasing revenue 250% and quadrupling the organization’s assets.
  Identifying a white-space opportunity to immerse C-suite leaders in Chicago’s
  civic landscape, she founded The Daniel Burnham Fellowship, which now
  represents 33% of total revenue and is recognized as an essential avenue for
  driving cross-sector collaboration and economic investment across the region.
  <br /><br />As CEO for Girl Scouts of Greater Chicago and Northwest Indiana,
  she helmed a merger consolidating seven independently operated entities into
  the largest council in the nation. During her five-year tenure, she matured
  the board of directors into a strategic philanthropic engine; increased
  revenue 18%; and incorporated next-generation science, technology, and
  engineering skills into programming reaching 84K girls. <br /><br />As a
  technology and marketing executive at Microsoft and Xerox, she earned a
  reputation for steering change amidst challenging conditions, P&amp;L
  leadership for nine-figure business units, deep market positioning and brand
  development prowess. At Microsoft, she created the Office of Citizenship and
  Innovation to accelerate technology-enabled workforce readiness, delivered
  top-five product growth in the $550M+ U.S. state and local government
  enterprise segment, and led a nationally recognized field-based marketing
  organization to outperform revenue and profitability goals.<br /><br />As
  general manager of Xerox’s Midwestern public sector operation, she reversed
  31% in revenue loss to 6% growth in a declining market as she led and
  motivated a 100-member team. Her efforts integrating the outsourcing business
  into the $1.4B public sector segment and rebuilding the field marketing
  organization enabled Xerox Business Services to capture market share in this
  previously untapped, high-potential segment and yield 24% revenue growth. <br
  /><br />As a civic leader, Maria has served as president of Goodman Theatre’s
  board of trustees <br /><br />and serves as board treasurer heading the
  finance and audit committees for P33. She is a multi-year member of The
  Economic Club of Chicago, The Chicago Network, The Chicago Club, and The
  Commercial Club of Chicago.<br /><br />Regularly recognized for her business
  contributions, Maria has been honored as the recipient of Latino Leaders
  Magazine’s 2022 Maestro of Entrepreneurship Award and by Crain’s Chicago
  Business multiple times, including as their one of their 2019 Notable Women
  Executives of Color and in 2019’s Who’s Who in Chicago Business. She was also
  selected by Chicago United to join their 2023 Business Leaders of Color
  cohort. <br /><br />Maria earned her MBA from Northern Illinois University and
  her bachelor’s degree from North Central College and has continued her
  executive education at Harvard Business School, Northwestern’s Kellogg School
  of Management, and the Center for Creative Leadership. She is fully bilingual
  in English and Spanish. She has conversational ability in French.
