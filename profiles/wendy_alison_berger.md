bio: Wendy A. Berger is the CEO of WBS Equities, LLC, a real estate development firm founded in 2004. WBS Equities, LLC specializes in sale leaseback transactions with food manufacturing and distribution companies. The company executes sale leaseback transactions, ground up construction and renovate to suit transactions. In her role as CEO, she has built a national reputation as an expert in constructing and renovating very complicated food manufacturing facilities and structuring complex transactions. WBS Equites has distinguished itself from its competitors by having a very long-term hold strategy for owned assets. <br />Wendy’s reputation in the food real estate world is well known. She is sought out as a frequent speaker on structuring sale lease back transactions and construction of specialized food and beverage real estate projects. <br /><br />Wendy has over 35 years of business leadership, having co-founded and an early employee of four companies which have grown dramatically in short periods of time, including employee #10 at Orbitz, the travel web site. Wendy has shown her leadership capabilities in building and leading high growth companies with a focus on financial strength as a foundation for supporting growth. Through her public company experience and non-profit board experience, Wendy has developed her expertise in corporate governance and compensation matters. Wendy served as Compensation Committee and Executive Committee Chair on the Board of Directors of Green Thumb industries (CSE&#58; GTII) (OTC&#58; GTBIF) (www.GTIgrows.com)<br /><br />This gave Wendy a strong foundation in risk assessment, structuring transactions, financial and credit analysis, and the primacy of customer relationships to building longer term business relationships. Wendy then pivoted to working in a third-generation family real estate business, Berger Realty Group (BRG). While at BRG, Wendy focused on implementing tenant retention strategies and cost reduction strategies which resulted in dramatic increases in valuation of the company’s assets. <br /><br />Wendy thrives in working with explosive growth companies, those looking to transform their businesses and with complex regulatory issues. She is also uniquely qualified to work with companies for whom real estate is not their core business but for which real estate plays a key role. Wendy believes that among her most valued skills is risk assessment. This has been key to taking on leadership roles with high growth companies. <br /><br />Most recently, Wendy served on the Board of Directors of Green Thumb Industries (CSE&#58; GTII) (OTC&#58; GTBIF) (www.GTIgrows.com) for 9 years including serving as its Compensation Committee Chair, Executive Committee Chair and Member of the Audit Committee.
