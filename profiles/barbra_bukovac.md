bio: As a Partner at PwC, Barb Bukovac has over three decades of experience advising companies, ranging from pre-IPO to Fortune 500, on strategic, operational, financial, tax, and governance matters. She is deeply experienced working with members of the C-Suite, Boards, and various committees on financial reporting, auditing, technology, regulatory, and governance matters. <br />Initially joining in 1988, Bukovac was admitted to the partnership in 2000 as an International Tax Partner. As one of the most senior female tax leaders and the firm’s first female Vice Chair, she ascended quickly through the ranks, owning P&amp;L with appointments to National Sector Leader-Tax, Vice Chair- Mid-Central Region, and Vice Chair-Consumer Markets. <br />As Senior Partner, she has advised some of the Firm’s largest clients through times of immense change and crisis, spanning M&amp;A, financial crises, global regulatory scrutiny, workforce and shareholder activism. To date, she has led several global M&amp;A transactions, including Kraft’s acquisition of Cadbury and spin-off transaction of the North American Grocery business. <br /><br />As Vice Chair of Consumer Markets, Bukovac led all aspects of Consulting and Tax practice development and delivery of services for marquee clients in the consumer-packaged goods, retail, transportation &amp; logistics, travel, and hospitality sectors, with a focus on global companies undergoing business transformations. Leveraging a broad perspective on risk, technology, tax, and value chain transformation, she advises clients on their most critical issues across supply chain, product innovation, shifting consumer behaviors, tariffs, and the impact of AI in the workforce. Experiencing the impact of business transformation first-hand as a member of PwC’s Consulting Leadership team, Bukovac played a key contributing role in capturing 43.5% growth by transforming PwC’s legacy operating and go to market model. <br /><br />Recognized for her strategic acumen and collaborative disposition, Bukovac was asked by PwC’s CEO to be a member of the U.S. Extended Leadership Team, where she worked with the Firm’s senior leaders to drive PwC’s strategic direction and ensure a culture where talent thrived. She was also appointed by the Board to the Firm’s Nominating Committee that selected PwC’s CEO slate for succession in 2016. <br />Bukovac was chosen to moderate sessions at PwC’s Trust Leadership Institute that convened senior executives, corporate board directors, and thought leaders to navigate the most complex issues facing businesses today and to identify powerful opportunities for action—covering topics that spanned across AI and GenAI investment and the impact of AI on the future workforce. <br /><br />Bukovac currently serves on the boards of Hadley (Audit Chair and Vice Chair, Executive Committee), The Chicago Network (Programming Chair and Board Member), NRF Foundation (Board Member), and the Dean’s Council for the University of Illinois Gies College of Business (Member). She is the incoming Chair for Hadley, a nonprofit organization serving the visually impaired, where she served on the CEO Search Committee. <br />Throughout her career, Bukovac has been committed to mentorship and the advancement and development of future women leaders. Known as a selfless leader who puts others first, she quickly builds trust and longstanding relationships. Exemplifying this commitment, she was a Partner Sponsor at PwC for three women partner candidates and utilized her position to help others succeed. <br />She has been recognized for her leadership with receipt of the Notable Leaders in Accounting Consulting &amp; Law (2024), Notable Women Executives (2020), Notable Women Executives Over 50 (2019) by Crain’s Chicago Business, Power 50 (2019) by the National Diversity Council, and Women’s Leadership Award (2019) by North Shore Women in Business.
