bio: Cheryl Lulias is a dynamic health care leader in value-based care delivery
  and pioneer in pursuit of essential industry transformation. She is the
  President and CEO of Medical Home Network (MHN), a nationally recognized
  health care organization dedicated to transforming care, reducing disparities,
  and building healthier communities. Under Cheryl’s leadership, MHN has taken a
  differentiated approach to tech-enabled delivery re-design and changed how
  healthcare is organized, delivered and financed, with a focus on underserved
  communities. Through its proven, scalable model, MHN creates integrated
  community-based delivery systems that enable high quality, patient centric,
  whole person care. At the same time, MHN organizes providers for success under
  full risk value-based arrangements, which benefit both health care
  organizations and patients. This approach has produced significant
  improvements in health outcomes, quality and cost through better patient
  engagement and better use of data and technology. In 2014, Cheryl launched the
  MHN ACO, the first Medicaid Accountable Care Organization in Illinois, which
  delivers nationally leading results and is recognized as the best performing
  Medicaid ACO in the country. Several years later in 2019, Cheryl co-founded
  and launched MoreCare, a Medicare Advantage health plan designed specifically
  for residents of Cook County, IL with a focus on special needs populations.
  Cheryl is focused on leading the next stage of MHN’s growth by replicating and
  scaling its approach and impact on a national level. Earlier this year, MHN
  received approval for participation in a new Medicare model called ACO REACH
  that emphasizes advancing health equity in underserved communities. Today MHN
  has expanded its REACH to nine states to transform care. Prior to MHN, Cheryl
  served as the Vice President of Network Management for WellCare Health Plans
  of Illinois, a provider of Medicaid and Medicare HMO products, and held
  managed care leadership positions at several academic and community hospital
  systems. Cheryl is a published author in academic journals, a frequent speaker
  and has received a variety of community awards for MHN’s groundbreaking work
  to transform care in Cook County, IL. Most recently, Cheryl was recognized as
  one of Modern Healthcare’s Top Women Leaders in Healthcare in 2022. In
  addition, MHN was named one of Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work in 2021
  and 2022.
