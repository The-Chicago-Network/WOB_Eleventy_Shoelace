bio: <br /><br />Michelle Morales is the President of the Woods Fund
  Chicago. Prior to Woods Fund, Michelle led the Illinois chapter of the Mikva
  Challenge, a premier youth development civics organization that creates space
  for youth civic participation and leadership. Michelle’s background has been
  in the field of alternative education, focusing on and advocating for
  educational justice, first as a teacher at the Dr. Pedro Albizu Campos
  Alternative High School in Chicago’s Humboldt Park community and then as
  Associate Director at the Alternative Schools Network. In addition, she was a
  community organizer for 16 years in Chicago’s Puerto Rican community,
  advocating for community development, education justice, economic justice, and
  against the rapid gentrification of the neighborhood. Michelle has 25+ years
  of experience in the non-profit sector in Chicago.<br /><br />She received a
  BA in Latin American/Latino Studies from DePaul University, a Master's in
  Special Education from the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a Master's
  in Educational Leadership from Northeastern Illinois University. <br /><br
  />Michelle has used her varied career opportunities, her experiences as a
  first-generation U.S.-born Puerto Rican woman and her platform to raise
  awareness and consciousness about the power of youth voice, the continued
  marginalization of youth of color, utilizing community input in decision
  making, and the diasporic experiences of colonized peoples living in the
  United States. She is also a vocal advocate concerning racially equitable
  workplaces and strongly encourages organizations and companies to not only
  apply a racial equity and justice lens externally but internally as well.
  Michelle has used her expertise in restructuring organizations to bring a
  racial equity lens to her service on boards.<br /><br />Michelle is honored to
  lead Woods Fund Chicago, a foundation dedicated to funding the community
  organizing and public policy advocacy sector in Chicago.
