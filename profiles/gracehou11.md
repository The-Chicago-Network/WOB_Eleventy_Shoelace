bio: Grace is uniquely qualified to advance and protect the interests and inspire and guide a company as a member of its board of directors. As a leader and member of and as a chief executive of several high impact boards of directors, Grace has a deep understanding of great governance, positive management of diverse board rooms, and the cultivation of positive ecosystems for organizations and staff to grow. She has been a member of the Gubernatorial Cabinet for one of the countryâ€™s largest states serving as the Secretary of the Illinois Department of Human Services (IDHS) for the past three and a half years. IDHS, an agency with 13,000 staff and a $12 billion budget, is responsible for serving one in three people in Illinois through its psychiatric hospitals, residential centers, public benefits offices, and community grant programs. <br /><br />Grace is a seasoned leader with broad and deep understanding of state government, human services, social determinants of health, Medicaid and other public benefits, and supports for people with disabilities. She is a locally and nationally recognized leader for transforming organizations compassionately, inspirationally, collaboratively, and efficiently. She has chaired almost all of the boards that she has been a member of - demonstrating her ability to gain the respect of chief executives and her peer board members. <br /><br />Being a child of immigrant parents, an American-born Chinese (ABC), and having explored and been a proactive learner of racial equity and diversity/equity/inclusion work and organizing - Grace has a way of introducing complicated and uncomfortable conversations and necessary change into organizations for positive growth and development.<br /><br />She would like to bring her professional and personal experience, insights, and governance mastery to a corporate board that seeks to advance its racial justice acumen, understand the social impact and government sectors, and grow its relevance broadly.
