bio: Julie is a dynamic leader with extensive experience as a COO managing
  complex Registered Investment Advisor (RIA) operations. She has an exceptional
  record of leading change to optimize growth and profitability, improve
  operational efficiency, enhance the client experience, and manage
  transformational acquisitions. As a Member of the Board of Directors and the
  Executive Leadership Team, she brings a reputation for strategic thinking,
  deep understanding of fiduciary responsibilities, and expertise in risk
  management, capital allocation, human capital, conflict resolution, and
  compliance within a highly regulated industry. <br /><br />As Chief Operating
  Officer, Managing Partner of Fiducient Advisors, a leading investment
  consulting firm with more than $300 billion in assets under advisement (AUA)
  and $55 billion in assets under management (AUM), Julie was recruited as
  firm’s first COO to lead business and investment operations and establish a
  disciplined platform for growth, supporting retirement plan, endowment /
  foundation, and private wealth clients. During her tenure, she led the
  integration of two investment consulting firms, establishing a unified
  infrastructure, technology, and human capital plan. She also developed a
  client complexity measurement strategy and a profitability model by line of
  business to optimize client service delivery and prioritize capital allocation
  decisions.<br /><br />While at RMB Capital, a Barron’s Top 30 RIA Firm, Julie
  served as Chief Administrative Officer and then Partner, Managing Director of
  Wealth Management, leading day-to-day operations of the $5.4 billion AUM
  Wealth Management business. She also served as a member of the Executive
  Committee, providing leadership for the firm’s expansion, with a doubling of
  assets under management to $9.4 billion in five years.<br /><br />During her
  tenure with Mesirow Financial, Julie served on the Executive Committee and the
  Board of Directors, which led the firm through dynamic periods of growth,
  diversification, and leadership transition. As Senior Managing Director, with
  P&amp;L ownership and fiduciary oversight of Investment Advisory / Private
  Client Services, she led the firm’s oldest line of business, focusing
  strategies, realigning disparate operations, and building a high-performance
  group of 55+ wealth advisers. She subsequently initiated a complex change
  management process that positioned the firm as an early leader in shifting
  from broker to investment adviser and grew assets under management to $4
  billion over five years. <br /><br />At Mesirow Financial, Julie also
  introduced the business model and launched the Investment Strategies Group,
  providing institutional plan sponsor consulting and asset allocation services.
  In six years, the Group raised $20 billion in AUA and achieved approximately
  40% market share among plans that hired a third-party fiduciary. At the same
  time, she established a dedicated Retirement Plan Advisory Services Group,
  growing AUA to $4 billion. In her early years with Mesirow, Julie served as
  the firm’s first Chief Marketing Officer and as Executive Vice President of
  the Skyline Fund.<br /><br />Julie holds a Master of Management degree from
  Northwestern University Kellogg Graduate School of Management and a Bachelor
  of Science in Marketing from Northern Illinois University.
