bio: After 30 years with Morningstar, Catherine retired in June 2018. As the
  firm’s first Strategy Officer starting in 2012, she was responsible for
  driving firm value by designing and implementing a strategic planning process;
  working with the executive team to focus resources on the initiatives and
  investments that create value; managing all M&amp;A activity, including
  acquisitions and their integration into the firm; managing firm-to-firm
  strategic relationships; and measuring results of strategic decisions. Prior
  to her strategy role, Catherine managed several businesses for the firm,
  including launching and developing Morningstar’s equity and credit research
  business, Morningstar.com, the firm’s flagship investment research website,
  and other products and services built around proprietary intellectual property
  and technology.<br /><br />Though retired from Morningstar, Catherine is the
  Morningstar representative on the board of Ellevest, a start-up financial
  planning and investment advice service oriented to women. Catherine is also a
  Trustee of the Chicago Architecture Center, a director of Northwestern
  Memorial HealthCare and a member of the Physical Sciences Division Council of
  the University of Chicago. She is an “armchair astrophysicist” with a
  particular interest in the intersection of astrophysics, quantum mechanics,
  and information science. A private investor since college, Catherine also
  spends time researching and making investments, still relying on Morningstar
  research, of course. She has AB and MBA degrees with several honors from the
  University of Chicago. Catherine is a member of The Chicago Network and the
  Economic Club of Chicago.
