bio: Roseanna Ander serves as the founding Executive Director of the University
  of Chicago Crime Lab and the University of Chicago Education Lab, established
  in 2008 and 2011, respectively. These research institutions – which have
  offices in both Chicago and New York – design, test, and scale data-driven
  programs to improve the public sector’s approach to two of the most pressing
  issues facing cities today&#58; public safety and education.<br /><br />Under
  Ander’s leadership, the Crime Lab and the Education Lab have produced
  cutting-edge research on gun violence prevention, criminal justice reform, and
  education that has led to significant impact and policy change in Chicago and
  across the nation. Education Lab research has helped generate more than $120
  million in public investment for highly effective, evidence-based programs to
  ensure all students have the opportunity for future success. The impact of the
  Crime Lab’s evaluation of Youth Guidance’s Becoming a Man (BAM) program, a
  cognitive-behavioral therapy program delivered in the Chicago Public Schools,
  led Chicago to redirect millions of dollars to expand the program’s strategy
  and support 57 nonprofits across the city. BAM and similar behavioral science
  approaches now play a vital role in the city’s efforts to reduce violence.<br
  /><br />During her tenure at the Crime Lab and Education Lab, Ander has also
  played a key role in the launch of two major national initiatives&#58; the
  Community Safety Leadership Academies (CSLA) and the Personalized Learning
  Initiative (PLI). The CSLA is composed of the Policing Leadership Academy and
  the Community Violence Intervention Leadership Academy and is designed to
  train future leaders in policing and community violence intervention. In the
  education sector, PLI aims to overcome pandemic learning loss by scaling
  high-dosage, high-impact tutoring in classrooms across the country. Ander was
  also instrumental in helping to launch the Rapid Employment and Development
  Initiative (READI), a program that connects men most at risk of gun violence
  involvement and victimization with cognitive-behavioral therapy, jobs, and
  wraparound supports.<br /><br />Ander has extensive experience as a policy
  advisor, including serving on the public safety transition teams for Chicago
  Mayors Lori Lightfoot and Rahm Emanuel and Illinois Governor Bruce Rauner, and
  she has been featured as a leader in Public Safety in Leaders magazine. .
  Prior to joining the University of Chicago, Ander oversaw the Joyce
  Foundation’s gun violence prevention program. Her contributions included
  providing seed funding for the National Violent Death Reporting System (NVDRS)
  and developing a seminal report on Firearm Violence for the National Academy
  of Sciences in 2005. At Joyce, she also advised on grantmaking for early
  childhood education efforts. Before her time at the Joyce Foundation, Ander
  served as a Soros Justice Fellow with the Massachusetts Attorney General’s
  Office and worked for the Harvard Injury Control Center and the Harvard
  Project on Schooling and Children. Ander holds an M.S. from the Harvard School
  of Public Health.
