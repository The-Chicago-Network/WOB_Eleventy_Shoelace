  />In March 2020, Karen Tamley became the new President and CEO of Access
  Living, a Chicago-based service and advocacy non-profit organization for
  people with disabilities. In her new role, Karen has returned to her roots,
  having served in multiple positions at Access Living from 1996 to 2005, under
  Access Living’s founding CEO Marca Bristo. <br /><br />Prior to becoming
  Access Living’s CEO, Karen served three Chicago Mayors as Commissioner of the
  Mayor’s Office for People with Disabilities. As Commissioner, Karen advanced
  accessibility and disability inclusion in the areas of transportation, city
  infrastructure, technology, emergency planning, education, and employment and
  oversaw the delivery of direct services to thousands of Chicago’s disabled
  youth and adults. In 2015, Karen received the Motorola Solutions Excellence in
  Public Service Award from the Civic Federation, which recognizes a non-elected
  government official for having an extraordinary impact on the quality of state
  and local government services in Illinois.<br /><br />In 2016, President Obama
  appointed Karen to serve on the United States Access Board, which develops
  national accessibility guidelines and standards, and she was elected as Chair
  in 2019. Most recently, Karen served as a member of the Biden-Harris
  Presidential Transition team.<br /><br />Over the past two decades, Tamley has
  served on a wide variety of government and nonprofit community boards at the
  national, state and local level, including Pace Suburban Bus, Dare2Tri and
  Kohl’s Children’s Museum. In 2015, she received the Distinguished Fellow award
  from Leadership Greater Chicago. <br /><br />Karen is a graduate of the
  University of California, Berkeley. She lives in Chicago with her husband,
  Kevin Irvine, and their teenage daughter. All three have disabilities
  themselves and are actively involved in disability advocacy locally and
  nationally.
