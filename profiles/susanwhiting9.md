She is also involved in private company board roles and early-stage private ventures.<br /><br />She most recently served as Vice Chair of Nielsen, the largest global research company measuring what consumers “watch” and “buy” in over 106 countries. As Vice Chair, she oversaw global communications & marketing, corporate social responsibility, public and government affairs, diversity and inclusion and global client engagement. While a business to business company, it remains a consumer brand that provides information about the consumption of programming, extending to social media and mobile platforms.<br /><br />Susan’s management experience included the start-up development of audience measures for cable television which led to the adoption of Nielsen’s digital measurement strategy and its focus upon measuring media audiences “anytime and anywhere.” Later roles spanned strategy, sales, product development, operations, and senior leadership as well as overseeing a global P&L, with direct responsibility of 50% of the profits for the company.<br /><br />Susan is also a volunteer leader and board member for not for profit organizations.

In addition, she has mentored female business leaders around the world.
