  first national magazine to launch a web site, and built an international,
  profitable, multi-revenue stream business including premium content,
  e-commerce, advertising and gaming, both online and mobile.  She greatly
  expanded the leveraging of the Playboy brand via licensing.  In her last year
  as CEO, Playboy generated close to $1 billion in global retail sales<br /><br
