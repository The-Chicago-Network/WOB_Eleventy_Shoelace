bio: Innovative Strategist, Brand Marketer, Experienced Director of High Growth
  Disruptive Businesses.<br /><br />A seasoned professional with more than
  thirty years’ experience at executive levels in both public and private
  companies, as well as multiple company directorships. Today, Christie is a
  director of Fyllo, a leading ad tech company, ScentBeauty, an incubator for
  brands of scented products sold both via retail and e-commerce platforms
  worldwide, R.D. Offutt Company, an international, family-owned multi-billion
  dollar agricultural conglomerate, and Metro Edge Development Partners, a
  unique commercial real estate firm focused on social impact, technology-driven
  developments. She also works directly with CEOs on strategy and innovation,
  including a rapidly growing technology company that has patented a method of
  extracting methane from the atmosphere and turning it into a new material with
  the durability of plastic but that’s ocean biodegradable.<br /><br />From
  2009-2013, Christie directed a new entity, Canyon Ranch Enterprises, to
  leverage the Canyon Ranch brand and content via multi-media and business
  partnerships in the healthy eating, personal care and employee wellness
  areas.<br /><br />From 1988-2008, Hefner was Chairman and CEO of Playboy
  Enterprises, Inc. making her the longest serving female Chairman and CEO of a
  U.S. public company. During her tenure, she oversaw policy, management and
  strategy in all areas of the company. When she retired more than 40% of
  Playboy executives were women - a first for a NYSE Company. For three years
  she was named to FORTUNE’s list of “The World’s Most Powerful Women.”<br /><br
  />At Playboy Enterprises, she led the recapitalization of the Company, making
  it the first NYSE corporation allowed to issue a second class of stock with
  disparate voting rights, expanding research analyst coverage and broadening
  institutional ownership. She restructured operations and initiated the
  Company’s highly successful electronic and international expansion.<br /><br
  />She extended its magazine franchise overseas and also developed the
  company’s profitable pay television business — the first time a magazine
  successfully leveraged its brand into a television network. Continuing the
  Company's electronic expansion, in 1994 Christie led the Company onto the
  Internet with the launch of Playboy.com, the first national magazine to launch
  a web site, and built an international, profitable, multi-revenue stream
  business including premium content, e-commerce, advertising and gaming, both
  online and mobile. She greatly expanded the leveraging of the Playboy brand
  via licensing. In her last year as CEO, Playboy generated close to $1 billion
  in global retail sales<br /><br />She was a founding member of The Chicago
  Network, The Committee of 200, and the Chicago Chapter of Women Corporate
  Directors, and she was the first woman elected into the Chicago Chapter of the
  Young Presidents’ Organization.<br /><br />Elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her
  junior year of college, she graduated from Brandeis University summa cum laude
  with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and American literature.
