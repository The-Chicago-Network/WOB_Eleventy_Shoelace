bio: Julieanna L. Richardson, Founder and President of The HistoryMakers, has a
  unique and diverse background in theatre, television production, and the cable
  television industry that created a unique path to founding and heading up the
  largest national collection effort of African American video oral histories on
  record since the WPA Slave Narratives. The HistoryMakers is a national,
  501(c)(3) non-profit educational institution headquartered in Chicago with
  regional offices in Atlanta, Georgia and the Washington, D.C. area. The
  HistoryMakers organization is committed to preserving, developing and
  providing easy access to an internationally recognized, archival collection of
  thousands of African American video oral histories. A 1980 graduate of Harvard
  Law School, Richardson graduated from Brandeis University with a double-major
  in Theatre Arts and American Studies, where she did extensive oral history
  interviews on the Harlem Renaissance and Langston Hughes. She worked as a
  corporate lawyer at the Chicago law firm of Jenner &amp; Block prior to
  serving in the early 1980s as the Cable Administrator for the City of Chicago
  Office of Cable Communications. Richardson currently sits on the Honors
  Council of Lawyers for the Creative Arts. She has been awarded Honorary
  Doctorates from Howard University (2012), Dominican University (2014) and
  Brandeis University (2016). She has also served as the commencement speaker
  for Dominican University as well as Brandeis University 65th commencement. In
  2014, Black Enterprise magazine awarded Richardson its 2014 Legacy Award, its
  highest recognition of womenâ€™s achievement. That same year, Richardson was
  profiled in American Masters&#58; The Boomer List, a PBS documentary and
  exhibition at the Newseum in Washington, D.C.
