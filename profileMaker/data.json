    "bio": "KIM TAYLOR \n\nKim Taylor joined the University of Chicago in 2014 as its Vice President and General Counsel. One of the world’s leading universities, the 8th largest employer in Chicago, with a $2.6bn budget and an $11bn endowment, Kim advises all units of the University including U.S and international affiliates and two Department of Energy National Laboratories – Argonne National Laboratory and Fermilab. Kim also leads the University’s Department of Safety and Security, managing a budget of $40m and approximately 170 employees. \n\nKim has proven experience as an operational leader in an industry in transition. She is a collaborative leader able to set a vision and drive cultural change.\n\nC-Suite Executive and Counselor\n\nKim is an accomplished C-Suite leader and strategic advisor, able to successfully navigate complex institutions and manage across a wide variety of constituents. She is a trusted partner to the CEO, board and senior executive team with particular expertise in strategic corporate transactions. She is able to develop strategies that that balance the needs and respect the interests of multiple, often competing stakeholders. Kim brings proven experience in corporate governance, privacy and data governance, labor and employment matters, international activities, technology transfer and licensing, compliance and enterprise risk management. Kim is deeply involved in the development of policies and operational initiatives. As a creative problem solver, Kim is adept at facilitating discussion and is an effective consensus builder, unafraid to take risk. \n\nShe is a team builder who is often called upon for special projects designed to advance the University’s critical objectives. Toward this end, Kim is accustomed to promoting stakeholder engagement as needed among faculty, staff, donors, students, alumni, parents, community representatives, and governmental agencies.\n\nKim has proven crisis management skills in a wide variety of high-profile matters. She is a steward of institutional values and culture. She brings excellent judgment and understands the need for timely, accountable, values-based response. Calm and pragmatic.\n\nExperienced Law Firm Leader\n\nPrior to joining the University, Kim was an equity partner of Kirkland & Ellis where she spent 18 years in the New York Office leading deal teams in a broad range of mergers, stock and asset acquisitions, divestitures, partnerships, debt and equity financings and recapitalizations for public and private companies.\n\nWhile at Kirkland & Ellis, Kim played an integral role in growing the New York Office. As Hiring Partner for the New York office, member of the management committee for the New York office, and a co-founder of the firm’s Women’s Leadership Initiative, Kim was a key player in building the office and integrating new hires in the firm’s culture.\n\nBoardroom Advisor and Participant\n\nKim is an expert in corporate and board governance with a nuanced understanding of board dynamics. She served as the senior advisor to the University of Chicago board chair and search committee for the University’s 14th President. Her excellent judgment, deep experience and creativity dealing with “people issues,” executive compensation and other human capital matters are invaluable for the President, board and other senior executives. She actively participates in all Executive, Audit Committee and Institutional Capacity (HR, IT, Safety and Security) committees of the University board in addition to board and committee meetings for Argonne and Fermi National Laboratories.\n\nKim is a board member of CRSP LLC, a financial data company founded by Chicago Booth School of Business that provides strategic financial data to leading academic, commercial and governmental clients including the stock index for Vanguard’s Total Market Index Fund (representing over $1.3 trillion of invested assets).\n\nOrganizations\n\nKim is a member of the Chicago Network.

She currently serves as a board director and executive advisor to publicly traded companies and private independent ventures. Ms. Whiting serves on the board of directors for publicly traded Alliant Energy Corporation (LNT) and Kemper Corporation (KMPR). She is also involved in private company board roles and early-stage private ventures.\n\nShe most recently served as Vice Chair of Nielsen, the largest global research company measuring what consumers “watch” and “buy” in over 106 countries. As Vice Chair, she oversaw global communications & marketing, corporate social responsibility, public and government affairs, diversity and inclusion and global client engagement. While a business to business company, it remains a consumer brand that provides information about the consumption of programming, extending to social media and mobile platforms.\n\nSusan’s management experience included the start-up development of audience measures for cable television which led to the adoption of Nielsen’s digital measurement strategy and its focus upon measuring media audiences “anytime and anywhere.” Later roles spanned strategy, sales, product development, operations, and senior leadership as well as overseeing a global P&L, with direct responsibility of 50% of the profits for the company.\n\nSusan is also a volunteer leader and board member for not for profit organizations. Most notably, she serves as Board Chair of The National Women’s History Museum in Washington, DC and as a board trustee for the Chicago Academy of Sciences’ Peggy Notebaert Nature Museum, which she recently chaired, as well as serving as a trustee for The Trust for Public Land and Denison University.

    "bio": "\n\nMichelle T. Boone is President of The Poetry Foundation based in Chicago, Illinois. Appointed in May 2021, she is the first woman and first African American to lead the organization. The Poetry Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine, is an independent literary organization committed to a vigorous presence for poetry in American culture. Its programs are designed to shape a receptive climate for poetry by developing new audiences, creating new avenues for delivery, and encouraging new kinds of poetry through innovative literary prizes and programs.\n\nPreviously, Boone was the Chief Program and Civic Engagement Officer at Navy Pier, an historic landmark and top cultural destination and attraction in the Midwest. In this role, Boone designed, developed, curated and presented Navy Pier’s arts and culture public programs, festivals and specials events, and was a member of the executive leadership team helping to shape organizational strategy and public engagement. Other duties included overseeing the PR/Communications division, responsible for marketing, promotion and branding, and the Pier’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategies and staff engagement. \n\nIn 2011, Michelle was appointed Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) by Mayor Rahm Emanuel. During her tenure, she led a team of more than 80 full-time employees to produce and present more than 2,000 public programs, large-scale festivals and special events annually; supervised the management of the historic Chicago Cultural Center; led the process for a new Chicago Cultural Plan (released in 2012); and launched the Chicago Architecture Biennial in 2015, the city’s first international exhibition of contemporary architecture and design. Prior to that, Michelle was a senior program officer at the Joyce Foundation (2004–2011) managing the culture portfolio and distributing more than $2 million annually in grants supporting artists and nonprofit arts organizations in six major Midwest cities (Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit, Cleveland, Indianapolis).\n\nHer professional career includes work in television, film and the recording industries, and she served as a United States Peace Corps Volunteer in Chad, Africa (1994-96). Michelle holds a bachelor’s degree in Telecommunications and a master’s degree in Public Affairs (Nonprofit Management) from Indiana University, Bloomington; in 2015, the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs honored her with its Distinguished Alumni Award. Boone is the recipient of multiple honors including being named a “Cultural Champion” by the Chicago Cultural Alliance in 2019; named “Design Leader of the Moment” by New City magazine (April 2019); and “Chicagoan of the Year” (architecture) by the Chicago Tribune in 2015. She currently serves on the boards of Americans for the Arts (vice chair); Arts Alliance Illinois (chair); The Arts Club of Chicago; Chicago Architecture Biennial; the Graham Foundation (secretary); Timeline Theater; and is on the Board of Governors for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.

Jackson became CEO of Hope Chicago, a new two-generation scholarship organization that will eliminate barriers to educational and economic equity by guaranteeing debt-free college and wraparound support services to Hope Scholars and their parents. Formerly served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), Dr. Jackson led the nation’s third-largest school district, with a budget of $7B serving over 340,000 students. With over 16 years of executive experience, Dr. Jackson is a transformational and strategic leader with a track record of improving academic outcomes in urban school systems, new school design, operational execution, leadership, and organizational change. Dr. Jackson has extensive skills and expertise in change management, communications, crisis management, labor management and negotiations, and risk management and mitigation. Adept in leading and managing through crisis and dynamic change, in 2018 Dr. Jackson led the first-of-its-kind Enterprise Risk Management assessment for CPS, leading to dramatic improvements in daily operations, audit reviews, public relations, and overall performance. In addition, Dr. Jackson has expertise in talent acquisition, development, and retention and is recognized as a local and national policy influencer.\n\nDr. Jackson is a 2007 Fellow of Leadership Greater Chicago. She serves on two private boards, Edmentum, one of the largest online learning providers in the US, and AllHere, a student engagement solution. She serves on multiple non-profit boards, including the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), A Better Chicago, The Chicago History Museum, and Advance Illinois. In these roles, Dr. Jackson has served on numerous Audit, Recruitment, and Selection Committees.\n\nDr. Jackson directly oversaw a $7B budget and managed the entire operations for an organization with over 45,000 employees. Jackson has negotiated several contracts with multi-labor unions totaling ~$2B during her tenure. Dr. Jackson is a leader in innovation and possesses a gift for vision and strategy. Dr. Jackson created a progressive five-year strategic plan with ambitious organizational goals. As CEO, she has led several major enterprise information system overhauls to ensure efficiency, increase productivity, and accountability while also protecting the organization by implementing the leading best practices in cybersecurity.\n\nMost recently, Dr. Jackson worked in partnership with the City of Chicago, the Chicago Teachers Union, local elected officials, the Chicago Department of Public Health, and a host of city agencies in response to the global pandemic.

Throughout this process, Desmond led highly demanding employee experience and organizational processes with ease and employee satisfaction.\n\nThese accomplishments, combined with legacy Morningstar programs that Desmond helped pioneer – such trust based employment policies and the firm’s sabbatical policy – have made Morningstar a workplace that's been widely awarded and recognized.\n\nBevin was one of three employees who started the company's international business in the late 1990s.

She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine and holds a level-one Professional Director Certification from the American College of Corporate Directors.\n\nDr. Allen-Meares served as Chancellor at UIC, the largest public research university in Chicago, from 2009 to 2015; in 2010, she was also appointed Vice President of the University of Illinois. She oversaw a budget of $2 billion, 15 academic units, and over 28,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff. On the heels of the Great Recession, she led “Brilliant Futures: The Campaign for the University of Illinois at Chicago” to raise $676 million, the most ever raised by UIC, that went toward increasing access to academic opportunity through financial aid; accelerating the discovery and dissemination of knowledge; enriching the student experience; and promoting healthy societies in Chicago and internationally. This was her third major fundraising campaign as a higher education administrator, all of which exceeded their goals.\n\nAt UIC, which includes UI Health, Dr. Allen-Meares oversaw a workforce comprising more than 25 labor unions and negotiated a new faculty contract that is regarded as one of the best in the nation for upholding academic excellence while balancing financial necessities. She also introduced new revenue streams and cluster hiring for diversifying a staff that included more than 20 percent veterans and visually impaired individuals. In collaboration with the Board of Trustees, Dr. Allen-Meares launched “Access to Excellence and Success,” a major initiative to improve student access, retention, and graduation rates, which increased retention of Black students by nearly 10 percent, eliminated the retention gap between Black and white students, and led to UIC being designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the Department of Education. She was called on by the Obama administration to participate in a series of White House conferences on student success and college affordability. She also worked with federal authorities to mitigate potential threats that could have emerged from the UIC campus, receiving one of the highest national security clearances by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIn 1993, Dr. Allen-Meares was appointed Dean of the U-M School of Social Work, ranked No. 1 in the country for nearly a decade. While she was Dean, the School’s endowment grew from $1 million to $43 million, and externally funded research awards reached more than $100 million. She led the initiative to relocate the program into a state-of-the-art facility on the U-M campus, including fundraising and construction; engaged new major donors, including philanthropist Ann Lurie and Harpo Studios co-founder Jeff Jacobs; and created new endowed chairs and student scholarships. She chaired the University Health Sciences Council and was a founding dean of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender Advisory Committee, the National Center for Institutional Diversity, and the U-M Detroit Center.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2008, Dr. Allen-Meares was a Trustee of the William T. Grant Foundation and served on the Nomination Commsittee (Chair) and the Research Committee. She was a New York Academy of Medicine Trustee and remains a Fellow, where she worked with other board members and then-mayor Michael Bloomberg on strategies to make New York City more livable for aging residents. She also served on the CEOs for Cities National Leadership Council. Elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2005, she was appointed Chair of Section X in 2009 and then co-chaired Section X for another two years. She served on the NAM Sarnat Prize Committee and the NAM Awards Committee and currently serves on the Health Division Committee. She is also a member of the Royal Society of Medicine (UK).\n\nDr. Allen-Meares is a member of the Chicago Network and serves on the Chicago Civic Consulting Alliance Board and the Council of Economic Advisors for the President of Cook County in Chicago; she recently served on the American Council on Education’s Commission on Inclusion and the Executive Committee for the Coalition for Urban Serving Universities. She has also served as elected President of the Society of Social Work and Research and has advised such universities as Washington University, Saint Louis University, University of Pittsburg, and University of Southern California.\n\nDr. Allen-Meares is author or co-author of more than 170 publications and serves on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals and publications. Her research interests include the functions of human service providers in educational settings and the challenges and strengths of diverse communities. Major themes in her research include improving the physical and mental health of underprivileged children and adolescents of color and the strengths of parents and communities. Her research is cited around the world, and her theoretical model on school social work for at-risk youth has been used in South Africa, South Korea, Australia, China, and Europe. Her project work has been funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Skillman Foundation.",

In addition, she was a community organizer for 16 years in Chicago’s Puerto Rican community, advocating for community development, education justice, economic justice, and against the rapid gentrification of the neighborhood. Michelle has 25+ years of experience in the non-profit sector in Chicago.\n\nShe received a BA in Latin American/Latino Studies from DePaul University, a Master's in Special Education from the University of Illinois at Chicago, and a Master's in Educational Leadership from Northeastern Illinois University. \n\nMichelle has used her varied career opportunities, her experiences as a first-generation U.S.-born Puerto Rican woman and her platform to raise awareness and consciousness about the power of youth voice, the continued marginalization of youth of color, utilizing community input in decision making, and the diasporic experiences of colonized peoples living in the United States. She is also a vocal advocate concerning racially equitable workplaces and strongly encourages organizations and companies to not only apply a racial equity and justice lens externally but internally as well. Michelle has used her expertise in restructuring organizations to bring a racial equity lens to her service on boards.\n\nMichelle is honored to lead Woods Fund Chicago, a foundation dedicated to funding the community organizing and public policy advocacy sector in Chicago.",

In 2019, she made history by being the first female elected to the Office of Treasurer for the City of Chicago who was not previously appointed.\nShe is a former State Representative for the 10th District who believes in the promise of opportunity and the strength of families to effectively address the needs of our communities.\nBefore being elected as a State Representative, she gained more than 15-years of experience in the insurance industry as an executive for Allstate and CS Insurance Strategies, gaining insight into the challenges in the diverse and vibrant City of Chicago.\n\nAs City Treasurer, she is the only city-wide elected official sitting on all four pension boards and has utilized her private-sector and financial experience to increase economic development in Chicago’s neighborhoods by raising awareness of systemic issues that result in racial inequities. Under her leadership, the Advancing Equity in Banking Commission (AEBC) was formed to advance equity and eliminate systemic racism in the banking industry through equitable hiring, lending, and investment in Black communities. She believes that Chicago’s nearly $10 billion-dollar portfolio should be leveraged to help Chicago communities grow at the same economic rate, regardless of their zip code.\nThe Treasurer also developed a year-long program, Hope Inside, to help people increase their credit scores. It offers credit and money management resources to Chicagoans—FOR FREE. It offers workshops that teach Chicagoans to create a budget, understand and fix errors on their credit reports, and start planning for homeownership. In the credit Coaching Sessions, a FREE one-on-one session with a counselor, you can make plans for getting out of debt and raising your credit score. With this partnership, we launched the 700 Credit Score Initiative, where residents have the opportunity to receive 18 months of continuous counseling that can raise their credit scores by 120 points—it's free to all Chicago residents.\nThe Treasurer and her office have developed many programs to assist the residents of Chicago to help make their lives better.\n# The Treasurer lives in Garfield Park with her husband Jason and daughter Jeneva. She is a proud member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.",

    "bio": "Melissa Conyears-Ervin is the current City Treasurer of the City of Chicago. In 2019, she made history by being the first female elected to the Office of Treasurer for the City of Chicago who was not previously appointed. \n\nShe is a former State Representative for the 10th District who believes in the promise of opportunity and the strength of families to effectively address the needs of our communities. \n\nBefore being elected as a State Representative, she gained more than 15-years of experience in the insurance industry as an executive for Allstate and CS Insurance Strategies, gaining insight into the challenges in the diverse and vibrant City of Chicago. \n\nAs City Treasurer, she is the only city-wide elected official sitting on all four pension boards and has utilized her private-sector and financial experience to increase economic development in Chicago’s neighborhoods by raising awareness of systemic issues that result in racial inequities. Under her leadership, the Advancing Equity in Banking Commission (AEBC) was formed to advance equity and eliminate systemic racism in the banking industry through equitable hiring, lending, and investment in Black communities. She believes that Chicago’s nearly $10 billion-dollar portfolio should be leveraged to help Chicago communities grow at the same economic rate, regardless of their zip code. \n\nThe Treasurer also developed a year-long program, Hope Inside, to help people increase their credit scores. It offers credit and money management resources to Chicagoans—FOR FREE. It offers workshops that teach Chicagoans to create a budget, understand and fix errors on their credit reports, and start planning for homeownership. In the credit Coaching Sessions, a FREE one-on-one session with a counselor, you can make plans for getting out of debt and raising your credit score. With this partnership, we launched the 700 Credit Score Initiative, where residents have the opportunity to receive 18 months of continuous counseling that can raise their credit scores by 120 points—it's free to all Chicago residents. \n\nThe Treasurer and her office have developed many programs to assist the residents of Chicago to help make their lives better. \n\nThe Treasurer lives in Garfield Park with her husband Jason and daughter Jeneva. She is a proud member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.",
