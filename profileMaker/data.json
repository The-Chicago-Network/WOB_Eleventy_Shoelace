    "bio": "Cheryl Lulias is a dynamic health care leader in value-based care delivery and pioneer in pursuit of essential industry transformation. She is the President and CEO of Medical Home Network (MHN), a nationally recognized health care organization dedicated to transforming care, reducing disparities, and building healthier communities. Under Cheryl’s leadership, MHN has taken a differentiated approach to tech-enabled delivery re-design and changed how healthcare is organized, delivered and financed, with a focus on underserved communities. Through its proven, scalable model, MHN creates integrated community-based delivery systems that enable high quality, patient centric, whole person care. At the same time, MHN organizes providers for success under full risk value-based arrangements, which benefit both health care organizations and patients. This approach has produced significant improvements in health outcomes, quality and cost through better patient engagement and better use of data and technology. In 2014, Cheryl launched the MHN ACO, the first Medicaid Accountable Care Organization in Illinois, which delivers nationally leading results and is recognized as the best performing Medicaid ACO in the country. Several years later in 2019, Cheryl co-founded and launched MoreCare, a Medicare Advantage health plan designed specifically for residents of Cook County, IL with a focus on special needs populations. Cheryl is focused on leading the next stage of MHN’s growth by replicating and scaling its approach and impact on a national level. Earlier this year, MHN received approval for participation in a new Medicare model called ACO REACH that emphasizes advancing health equity in underserved communities. Today MHN has expanded its REACH to nine states to transform care. Prior to MHN, Cheryl served as the Vice President of Network Management for WellCare Health Plans of Illinois, a provider of Medicaid and Medicare HMO products, and held managed care leadership positions at several academic and community hospital systems.  Cheryl is a published author in academic journals, a frequent speaker and has received a variety of community awards for MHN’s groundbreaking work to transform care in Cook County, IL. Most recently, Cheryl was recognized as one of Modern Healthcare’s Top Women Leaders in Healthcare in 2022. In addition, MHN was named one of Modern Healthcare’s Best Places to Work in 2021 and 2022.",

In her 10 years at the helm, Emily drove record profits, acquired the innovative and industry-leading Social News Desk suppling newsroom software services to 2700 network, local TV, radio and newspaper companies across the globe and led the acquisition of WSLS-TV, the NBC affiliate in Roanoke, VA.

    "bio": "\n\nMichelle T. Boone is President of The Poetry Foundation based in Chicago, Illinois. Appointed in May 2021, she is the first woman and first African American to lead the organization. The Poetry Foundation, publisher of Poetry magazine, is an independent literary organization committed to a vigorous presence for poetry in American culture. Its programs are designed to shape a receptive climate for poetry by developing new audiences, creating new avenues for delivery, and encouraging new kinds of poetry through innovative literary prizes and programs.\n\nPreviously, Boone was the Chief Program and Civic Engagement Officer at Navy Pier, an historic landmark and top cultural destination and attraction in the Midwest. In this role, Boone designed, developed, curated and presented Navy Pier’s arts and culture public programs, festivals and specials events, and was a member of the executive leadership team helping to shape organizational strategy and public engagement. Other duties included overseeing the PR/Communications division, responsible for marketing, promotion and branding, and the Pier’s Diversity, Equity and Inclusion strategies and staff engagement.   \n\nIn 2011, Michelle was appointed Commissioner of the Chicago Department of Cultural Affairs and Special Events (DCASE) by Mayor Rahm Emanuel.  During her tenure, she led a team of more than 80 full-time employees to produce and present more than 2,000 public programs, large-scale festivals and special events annually; supervised the management of the historic Chicago Cultural Center; led the process for a new Chicago Cultural Plan (released in 2012); and launched the Chicago Architecture Biennial in 2015, the city’s first international exhibition of contemporary architecture and design. Prior to that, Michelle was a senior program officer at the Joyce Foundation (2004–2011) managing the culture portfolio and distributing more than $2 million annually in grants supporting artists and nonprofit arts organizations in six major Midwest cities (Chicago, Milwaukee, Minneapolis-St. Paul, Detroit, Cleveland, Indianapolis).\n\n\n\nHer professional career includes work in television, film and the recording industries, and she served as a United States Peace Corps Volunteer in Chad, Africa (1994-96). Michelle holds a bachelor’s degree in Telecommunications and a master’s degree in Public Affairs (Nonprofit Management) from Indiana University, Bloomington; in 2015, the IU School of Public and Environmental Affairs honored her with its Distinguished Alumni Award. Boone is the recipient of multiple honors including being named a “Cultural Champion” by the Chicago Cultural Alliance in 2019; named “Design Leader of the Moment” by New City magazine (April 2019); and “Chicagoan of the Year” (architecture) by the Chicago Tribune in 2015. She currently serves on the boards of Americans for the Arts (vice chair); Arts Alliance Illinois (chair); The Arts Club of Chicago; Chicago Architecture Biennial; the Graham Foundation (secretary); Timeline Theater; and is on the Board of Governors for the School of the Art Institute of Chicago. She is a member of The Chicago Network.

    "bio": "In September 2021, Dr. Janice K. Jackson became CEO of Hope Chicago, a new two-generation scholarship organization that will eliminate barriers to educational and economic equity by guaranteeing debt-free college and wraparound support services to Hope Scholars and their parents. Formerly served as the Chief Executive Officer of the Chicago Public Schools (CPS), Dr. Jackson led the nation’s third-largest school district, with a budget of $7B serving over 340,000 students. With over 16 years of executive experience, Dr. Jackson is a transformational and strategic leader with a track record of improving academic outcomes in urban school systems, new school design, operational execution, leadership, and organizational change. Dr. Jackson has extensive skills and expertise in change management, communications, crisis management, labor management and negotiations, and risk management and mitigation. Adept in leading and managing through crisis and dynamic change, in 2018 Dr. Jackson led the first-of-its-kind Enterprise Risk Management assessment for CPS, leading to dramatic improvements in daily operations, audit reviews, public relations, and overall performance. In addition, Dr. Jackson has expertise in talent acquisition, development, and retention and is recognized as a local and national policy influencer.\n\nDr. Jackson is a 2007 Fellow of Leadership Greater Chicago. She serves on two private boards, Edmentum, one of the largest online learning providers in the US, and AllHere, a student engagement solution. She serves on multiple non-profit boards, including the Collaborative for Academic, Social, and Emotional Learning (CASEL), A Better Chicago, The Chicago History Museum, and Advance Illinois. In these roles, Dr. Jackson has served on numerous Audit, Recruitment, and Selection Committees.\n\nDr. Jackson directly oversaw a $7B budget and managed the entire operations for an organization with over 45,000 employees. Jackson has negotiated several contracts with multi-labor unions totaling ~$2B during her tenure. Dr. Jackson is a leader in innovation and possesses a gift for vision and strategy. Dr. Jackson created a progressive five-year strategic plan with ambitious organizational goals. As CEO, she has led several major enterprise information system overhauls to ensure efficiency, increase productivity, and accountability while also protecting the organization by implementing the leading best practices in cybersecurity.\n\nMost recently, Dr. Jackson worked in partnership with the City of Chicago, the Chicago Teachers Union, local elected officials, the Chicago Department of Public Health, and a host of city agencies in response to the global pandemic. Dr. Jackson launched a comprehensive reopening framework that included health and safety protocols, remote learning guidelines, and support resources. Her collaborative efforts and forward-thinking have positioned the school district to navigate smartly through the human and educational challenges associated with the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nDr. Jackson is a highly regarded public speaker and thought leader in the field of education policy and leadership. In addition to a wide array of authentic and long-term relationships with local and national lawmakers, she has delivered passionate testimony regarding the negative impact of gun violence and poverty on children’s ability to learn on Capitol Hill. She has delivered testimony at the local and federal levels to influence policy on a variety of educational policy issues. As a district leader, she has been hugely instrumental in advocating for evidence-based funding for CPS and worked closely with elected officials to sign into law the landmark Evidence-Based Funding for the Student Success Act. Dr. Jackson’s leadership and track record have been leveraged in building a national multi-media marketing strategy.\n\nAlthough Dr. Jackson has spent her entire professional career in CPS, she has been able to be entrepreneurial and bring about dramatic change in a complex system. Prior to her recent executive roles, she founded and led two successful Chicago public high schools.\n\nBoth institutions exceeded district averages across multiple performance indicators. She holds two degrees from Chicago State University and advanced degrees from the University of Illinois at Chicago which include a Master's in Leadership and Administration and a Doctorate in Education in Policy Studies in Urban School Leadership. Dr. Jackson resides on the south side of Chicago with her husband, Torrence, and two children.",

Her leadership spans teams that innovate the workplace: talent acquisition, management and development; total rewards; and T&C operations. Bevin leads the development of centers in India and China to support Morningstar’s growing businesses.\n\n\n\nFrom her very first years at Morningstar, Bevin – a leader who applies vision and deep business acumen – has been building a talent capability that has resulted in Morningstar’s ability to hire high-potential and diverse employees. Desmond has overseen major organizational architecture changes as well as significant sophistication in operations over her almost 30 years of tenure.\n\nBevin was one of three employees who started the company's international business in the late 1990s. In the last 10 years alone, firm revenue from outside the United States has more than doubled. Desmond is credited with developing a truly global business in 27 countries that ensured Morningstar’s successful growth from $150 million to a thriving $1 billion+ organization today.\n\n\n\nBevin has been shaping the organizational and people needs that come with massive growth, from approx. 5,000 employees in 2018 to nearly 7,000 in 2019 and 9,500 in 2021. In 2019, Morningstar acquired global credit ratings agency DBRS, and in 2021, Sustainalytics, a leading ESG firm. Throughout this process, Desmond led highly demanding employee experience and organizational processes with ease and employee satisfaction.\n\nThese accomplishments, combined with legacy Morningstar programs that Desmond helped pioneer – such trust based employment policies and the firm’s sabbatical policy – have made Morningstar a workplace that's been widely awarded and recognized.\n\n\n\nBevin was one of three employees who started the company's international business in the late 1990s. In the last 10 years alone, firm revenue from outside the United States has more than doubled.

From acquiring business to building teams from scratch, Bevin led more than 30 acquisitions and countless organizational development efforts to architect Morningstar’s business outside the US.\n\n\n\nDesmond has been in an executive role at Morningstar for nearly 20 years. As president of international operations and head of global markets, she has helped transform the firm from a U.S. business to a global research powerhouse.\n\n\n\nUnder Desmond's leadership, Morningstar was named to Bloomberg’s Gender-Equality Index for the second consecutive year in 2020. Nearly 40% of Morningstar's workforce is female; at the senior level, 25% of Morningstar's executives/senior directors are female (compared to the industry average of 21.9%).",

    "bio": "Paula Allen-Meares\n\n<span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif; color: windowtext;\">Chancellor Emerita; </span><span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;\">John Corbally Presidential Professor Emerita; and Professor of Medicine, College of Medicine - </span>University of Illinois at Chicago\n\n<span style=\"font-family: \"Times New Roman\", serif;\">Dean and Professor Emerita and Norma Radin Collegiate Professor - </span>University of Michigan\n\nDr. Paula Allen-Meares’ roles as Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Dean of the schools of social work at University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have provided her with significant experience in financial stewardship, labor relations, and workforce diversification. An international expert on educational access and success, human services in educational settings, and physical and mental health in under-resourced communities, Dr. Allen-Meares has published numerous articles and books, and her counsel has been sought by nonprofit boards, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the states of Illinois and Michigan, and the Obama and Trump administrations. She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine and holds a level-one Professional Director Certification from the American College of Corporate Directors.\n\nDr. Allen-Meares served as Chancellor at UIC, the largest public research university in Chicago, from 2009 to 2015; in 2010, she was also appointed Vice President of the University of Illinois. She oversaw a budget of $2 billion, 15 academic units, and over 28,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff. On the heels of the Great Recession, she led “Brilliant Futures: The Campaign for the University of Illinois at Chicago” to raise $676 million, the most ever raised by UIC, that went toward increasing access to academic opportunity through financial aid; accelerating the discovery and dissemination of knowledge; enriching the student experience; and promoting healthy societies in Chicago and internationally. This was her third major fundraising campaign as a higher education administrator, all of which exceeded their goals.\n\nAt UIC, which includes UI Health, Dr. Allen-Meares oversaw a workforce comprising more than 25 labor unions and negotiated a new faculty contract that is regarded as one of the best in the nation for upholding academic excellence while balancing financial necessities. She also introduced new revenue streams and cluster hiring for diversifying a staff that included more than 20 percent veterans and visually impaired individuals. In collaboration with the Board of Trustees, Dr. Allen-Meares launched “Access to Excellence and Success,” a major initiative to improve student access, retention, and graduation rates, which increased retention of Black students by nearly 10 percent, eliminated the retention gap between Black and white students, and led to UIC being designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the Department of Education. She was called on by the Obama administration to participate in a series of White House conferences on student success and college affordability. She also worked with federal authorities to mitigate potential threats that could have emerged from the UIC campus, receiving one of the highest national security clearances by the U.S. Department of Defense.\n\nIn 1993, Dr. Allen-Meares was appointed Dean of the U-M School of Social Work, ranked No. 1 in the country for nearly a decade. While she was Dean, the School’s endowment grew from $1 million to $43 million, and externally funded research awards reached more than $100 million. She led the initiative to relocate the program into a state-of-the-art facility on the U-M campus, including fundraising and construction; engaged new major donors, including philanthropist Ann Lurie and Harpo Studios co-founder Jeff Jacobs; and created new endowed chairs and student scholarships. She chaired the University Health Sciences Council and was a founding dean of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender Advisory Committee, the National Center for Institutional Diversity, and the U-M Detroit Center.\n\nFrom 1999 to 2008, Dr. Allen-Meares was a Trustee of the William T. Grant Foundation and served on the Nomination Committee (Chair) and the Research Committee. She was a New York Academy of Medicine Trustee and remains a Fellow, where she worked with other board members and then-mayor Michael Bloomberg on strategies to make New York City more livable for aging residents. She also served on the CEOs for Cities National Leadership Council. Elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2005, she was appointed Chair of Section X in 2009 and then co-chaired Section X for another two years. She served on the NAM Sarnat Prize Committee and the NAM Awards Committee and currently serves on the Health Division Committee. She is also a member of the Royal Society of Medicine (UK).\n\nDr. Allen-Meares is a member of the Chicago Network and serves on the Chicago Civic Consulting Alliance Board and the Council of Economic Advisors for the President of Cook County in Chicago; she recently served on the American Council on Education’s Commission on Inclusion and the Executive Committee for the Coalition for Urban Serving Universities. She has also served as elected President of the Society of Social Work and Research and has advised such universities as Washington University, Saint Louis University, University of Pittsburg, and University of Southern California.\n\n\n\nDr. Allen-Meares is author or co-author of more than 170 publications and serves on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals and publications. Her research interests include the functions of human service providers in educational settings and the challenges and strengths of diverse communities. Major themes in her research include improving the physical and mental health of underprivileged children and adolescents of color and the strengths of parents and communities. Her research is cited around the world, and her theoretical model on school social work for at-risk youth has been used in South Africa, South Korea, Australia, China, and Europe. Her project work has been funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Skillman Foundation.",

In 2019, she made history by being the first female elected to the Office of Treasurer for the City of Chicago who was not previously appointed.\nShe is a former State Representative for the 10th District who believes in the promise of opportunity and the strength of families to effectively address the needs of our communities.\nBefore being elected as a State Representative, she gained more than 15-years of experience in the insurance industry as an executive for Allstate and CS Insurance Strategies, gaining insight into the challenges in the diverse and vibrant City of Chicago.\n\nAs City Treasurer, she is the only city-wide elected official sitting on all four pension boards and has utilized her private-sector and financial experience to increase economic development in Chicago’s neighborhoods by raising awareness of systemic issues that result in racial inequities. Under her leadership, the Advancing Equity in Banking Commission (AEBC) was formed to advance equity and eliminate systemic racism in the banking industry through equitable hiring, lending, and investment in Black communities. She believes that Chicago’s nearly $10 billion-dollar portfolio should be leveraged to help Chicago communities grow at the same economic rate, regardless of their zip code.\nThe Treasurer also developed a year-long program, Hope Inside, to help people increase their credit scores. It offers credit and money management resources to Chicagoans—FOR FREE. It offers workshops that teach Chicagoans to create a budget, understand and fix errors on their credit reports, and start planning for homeownership. In the credit Coaching Sessions, a FREE one-on-one session with a counselor, you can make plans for getting out of debt and raising your credit score. With this partnership, we launched the 700 Credit Score Initiative, where residents have the opportunity to receive 18 months of continuous counseling that can raise their credit scores by 120 points—it's free to all Chicago residents.\nThe Treasurer and her office have developed many programs to assist the residents of Chicago to help make their lives better.\n# The Treasurer lives in Garfield Park with her husband Jason and daughter Jeneva. She is a proud member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.",

    "bio": "Melissa Conyears-Ervin is the current City Treasurer of the City of Chicago. In 2019, she made history by being the first female elected to the Office of Treasurer for the City of Chicago who was not previously appointed. \n\nShe is a former State Representative for the 10th District who believes in the promise of opportunity and the strength of families to effectively address the needs of our communities. \n\nBefore being elected as a State Representative, she gained more than 15-years of experience in the insurance industry as an executive for Allstate and CS Insurance Strategies, gaining insight into the challenges in the diverse and vibrant City of Chicago. \n\nAs City Treasurer, she is the only city-wide elected official sitting on all four pension boards and has utilized her private-sector and financial experience to increase economic development in Chicago’s neighborhoods by raising awareness of systemic issues that result in racial inequities. Under her leadership, the Advancing Equity in Banking Commission (AEBC) was formed to advance equity and eliminate systemic racism in the banking industry through equitable hiring, lending, and investment in Black communities. She believes that Chicago’s nearly $10 billion-dollar portfolio should be leveraged to help Chicago communities grow at the same economic rate, regardless of their zip code. \n\nThe Treasurer also developed a year-long program, Hope Inside, to help people increase their credit scores. It offers credit and money management resources to Chicagoans—FOR FREE. It offers workshops that teach Chicagoans to create a budget, understand and fix errors on their credit reports, and start planning for homeownership. In the credit Coaching Sessions, a FREE one-on-one session with a counselor, you can make plans for getting out of debt and raising your credit score. With this partnership, we launched the 700 Credit Score Initiative, where residents have the opportunity to receive 18 months of continuous counseling that can raise their credit scores by 120 points—it's free to all Chicago residents. \n\nThe Treasurer and her office have developed many programs to assist the residents of Chicago to help make their lives better. \n\nThe Treasurer lives in Garfield Park with her husband Jason and daughter Jeneva. She is a proud member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.",

Today, Christie is Chairman of the Board of Hatchbeauty Brands, which partners with leading retailers bring brands to life with superior speed and precision. She’s also director of Fyllo, a leading innovator in data, media and compliance solutions for highly regulated industries, and of Healthwell, a SPAC targeting technology-enabled healthcare businesses. She also works directly with CEOs on strategy innovation, including the digital transformation of a media company and the rapid growth of a technology company that has patented a method of extracting methane from the atmosphere and turning it into a new material with the durability of plastic but that’s ocean biodegradable.\n\n \n\nFrom 2009-2013, Christie directed a new entity, Canyon Ranch Enterprises, to leverage the Canyon Ranch brand and content via multi-media and business partnerships in the healthy eating, personal care and employee wellness areas.\n\nFrom 1988-2008, Hefner was Chairman and CEO of Playboy Enterprises, Inc. making her the longest serving female Chairman and CEO of a U.S. public company. During her tenure, she oversaw policy, management and strategy in all areas of the company. When she retired more than 40% of Playboy executives were women - a first for a NYSE Company. For three years she was named to FORTUNE’s list of “The World’s Most Powerful Women.”\n\nAt Playboy Enterprises, she led the recapitalization of the Company, making it the first NYSE corporation allowed to issue a second class of stock with disparate voting right,, expanding research analyst coverage and broadening institutional ownership. She restructured operations and initiated the Company’s highly successful electronic and international expansion.\n\n \n\nShe extended its magazine franchise overseas and also developed the company’s profitable pay television business — the first time a magazine successfully leveraged its brand into a television network. Continuing the Company's electronic expansion, in 1994 Christie led the Company onto the Internet with the launch of Playboy.com, the first national magazine to launch a web site, and built an international, profitable, multi-revenue stream business including premium content, e-commerce, advertising and gaming, both online and mobile. She greatly expanded the leveraging of the Playboy brand via licensing. In her last year as CEO, Playboy generated close to $1 billion in global retail sales.\n\nShe was a founding member of The Chicago Network, The Committee of 200, and the Chicago Chapter of Women Corporate Directors, and she was the first woman elected into the Chicago Chapter of the Young Presidents’ Organization.\n\nElected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year of college, she graduated from Brandeis University summa cum laude with a Bachelor of Arts degree in English and American literature.<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;color:windowtext;\nlayout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"></span>\n\n <span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"></span> \n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\"><span style=\"text-decoration:none\"> </span></span>\n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\">For Profit Boards</span>:\n\n \n\n<span style=\"font-size:10.0pt;font-family:\"Times New Roman\",serif;\ncolor:windowtext;layout-grid-mode:line;mso-bidi-font-style:italic\">Present</span>\n\n \n\nHatchbeauty Brands                                       2014 to present\n\nA beauty innovation company that specializes in working with major retailers to develop brands  \n\nproducts.
