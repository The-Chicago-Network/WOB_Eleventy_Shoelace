bio: After graduating from The University of Notre Dame with an accounting degree, I joined PWC as an auditor for 7 years focusing in the sectors of hospitality, heavy manufacturing and hedge funds. While earning my MBA from Booth at The University of Chicago, I joined Grosvenor Capital Management and became a Managing Partner. After 6 1/2 years at Grosvenor, I left to build Aurora Investment Management into an alternative investment firm which managed $14 billion in AUM, focused on hedge fund investing. After retiring in 2016, I founded OceanM19 LLC, my family's investment office and engage in civic leadership roles.
