<h1>Paula G. Allen-Meares</h1>
<p class="titleEmployer">Chancellor Emerita, John Corbally Presidential Professor Emerita, Professor of Medicine, Executive Director - Office of Health Literacy, Faculty Affiliate-IMHR (University of Illinois at Chicago), Dean and Professor Emerita/Norma Radin Collegiate Professor (University of Michigan), University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC)</p>
<p>Dr. Paula Allen-Meares’ roles as Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Dean of the schools of social work at University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have provided her with significant experience in financial stewardship, labor relations, and workforce diversification. An international expert on educational access and success, human services in educational settings, and physical and mental health in under-resourced communities, Dr. Allen-Meares has published numerous articles and books, and her counsel has been sought by nonprofit boards, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, the states of Illinois and Michigan, and the Obama and Trump administrations. She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine and holds a level-one Professional Director Certification from the American College of Corporate Directors.<br /><br />Dr. Allen-Meares served as Chancellor at UIC, the largest public research university in Chicago, from 2009 to 2015; in 2010, she was also appointed Vice President of the University of Illinois. She oversaw a budget of $2 billion, 15 academic units, and over 28,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff. On the heels of the Great Recession, she led “Brilliant Futures&#58; The Campaign for the University of Illinois at Chicago” to raise $676 million, the most ever raised by UIC, that went toward increasing access to academic opportunity through financial aid; accelerating the discovery and dissemination of knowledge; enriching the student experience; and promoting healthy societies in Chicago and internationally. This was her third major fundraising campaign as a higher education administrator, all of which exceeded their goals.<br /><br />At UIC, which includes UI Health, Dr. Allen-Meares oversaw a workforce comprising more than 25 labor unions and negotiated a new faculty contract that is regarded as one of the best in the nation for upholding academic excellence while balancing financial necessities. She also introduced new revenue streams and cluster hiring for diversifying a staff that included more than 20 percent veterans and visually impaired individuals. In collaboration with the Board of Trustees, Dr. Allen-Meares launched “Access to Excellence and Success,” a major initiative to improve student access, retention, and graduation rates, which increased retention of Black students by nearly 10 percent, eliminated the retention gap between Black and white students, and led to UIC being designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the Department of Education. She was called on by the Obama administration to participate in a series of White House conferences on student success and college affordability. She also worked with federal authorities to mitigate potential threats that could have emerged from the UIC campus, receiving one of the highest national security clearances by the U.S. Department of Defense.<br /><br />In 1993, Dr. Allen-Meares was appointed Dean of the U-M School of Social Work, ranked No. 1 in the country for nearly a decade. While she was Dean, the School’s endowment grew from $1 million to $43 million, and externally funded research awards reached more than $100 million. She led the initiative to relocate the program into a state-of-the-art facility on the U-M campus, including fundraising and construction; engaged new major donors, including philanthropist Ann Lurie and Harpo Studios co-founder Jeff Jacobs; and created new endowed chairs and student scholarships. She chaired the University Health Sciences Council and was a founding dean of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender Advisory Committee, the National Center for Institutional Diversity, and the U-M Detroit Center.<br /><br />From 1999 to 2008, Dr. Allen-Meares was a Trustee of the William T. Grant Foundation and served on the Nomination Commsittee (Chair) and the Research Committee. She was a New York Academy of Medicine Trustee and remains a Fellow, where she worked with other board members and then-mayor Michael Bloomberg on strategies to make New York City more livable for aging residents. She also served on the CEOs for Cities National Leadership Council. Elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2005, she was appointed Chair of Section X in 2009 and then co-chaired Section X for another two years. She served on the NAM Sarnat Prize Committee and the NAM Awards Committee and currently serves on the Health Division Committee. She is also a member of the Royal Society of Medicine (UK).<br /><br />Dr. Allen-Meares is a member of the Chicago Network and serves on the Chicago Civic Consulting Alliance Board and the Council of Economic Advisors for the President of Cook County in Chicago; she recently served on the American Council on Education’s Commission on Inclusion and the Executive Committee for the Coalition for Urban Serving Universities. She has also served as elected President of the Society of Social Work and Research and has advised such universities as Washington University, Saint Louis University, University of Pittsburg, and University of Southern California.<br /><br />Dr. Allen-Meares is author or co-author of more than 170 publications and serves on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals and publications. Her research interests include the functions of human service providers in educational settings and the challenges and strengths of diverse communities. Major themes in her research include improving the physical and mental health of underprivileged children and adolescents of color and the strengths of parents and communities. Her research is cited around the world, and her theoretical model on school social work for at-risk youth has been used in South Africa, South Korea, Australia, China, and Europe. Her project work has been funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Skillman Foundation.</p>
