Throughout this process, Desmond led highly demanding employee experience and organizational processes with ease and employee satisfaction.<br /><br />These accomplishments, combined with legacy Morningstar programs that Desmond helped pioneer – such trust based employment policies and the firm’s sabbatical policy – have made Morningstar a workplace that's been widely awarded and recognized.<br /><br />Bevin was one of three employees who started the company's international business in the late 1990s.
