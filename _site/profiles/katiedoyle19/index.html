<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>Katie Doyle has 30 years of experience leading and advising consumer nutrition companies with a proven track record of delivering outstanding shareholder value across both private and publicly listed companies. Katie’s experiences have been concentrated on brands and retailers that have a heavy direct-to-consumer, omnichannel and digital growth agenda. Katie currently serves on a number of private and public company boards. Since 2019, Katie has served on the Board of Directors for AholdDelhaize, a $75b, global grocery retailer who is delivering against today’s consumers’ desire for healthier foods and meal solutions through seamless, personalized omnichannel experiences. Katie is the Chair of the Health and Sustainability Committee and also serves on the Nominating and Governance Committee. In 2020, Katie was elected to serve on the Board of Directors of Perrigo, a global life sciences company focused on consumer self-care products through omnichannel retail channels and serves on the Audit Committee. In 2021, Katie joined two private equity backed boards including Orgain which is a fast-growing organic and plant based nutrition brand as well as FoodScience Corporation which has a number of leading pet and human nutrition brands. In addition, Katie is on the Board of Advisors for League, a consumer health tech platform. Previously, Katie served as a Board Director for Bemis Company which was a publicly traded global packaging company that was subsequently acquired by Amcor. <br /><br />Prior to full-time board work, Katie was the Chief Executive Officer at Swanson Health, a private equity backed mid-cap e-commerce health and wellness brand where she remains an advisor and investor. While CEO, Katie led the transformation of a heritage brand, product portfolio and business model by leveraging technology, data analytics, digital marketing, product innovations and high-quality manufacturing to attract today’s wellness consumer. Prior to joining Swanson Health, Katie was a Senior Vice President and Corporate Officer at Abbott Laboratories where she led the Abbott Nutrition Products Division responsible for $3.2 billion in revenue across a portfolio of consumer health brands in the pediatric, adult and sports nutrition categories. Earlier, Katie was a senior Partner at McKinsey & Company for over 10 years where she primarily worked with leading consumer and retail companies. <br /><br />Katie’s undergraduate degree is from Georgetown University in Business with a major in finance and graduate degree from Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies.
