<h2>Bio:</h2>
<p>As President and CEO of Navy Pier, Inc., one of Chicago’s most visible nonprofits and the Midwest’s leading leisure destination, Marilynn Kelly Gardner has built a strong reputation as one of Chicago’s most respected female leaders.<br /><br />Since being appointed to her current role in 2011, Gardner has been the driving force behind Navy Pier’s redevelopment. Totaling investment of more than $400M to date, the multi-year revitalization has updated and transformed the 50 acres of Chicago’s premier urban waterfront space into a spectacular, global destination and resource for the community. Gardner has overseen every facet of the Pier’s physical, programmatic, and organizational transformation, establishing Navy Pier as a top nonprofit cultural destination. <br /><br />For most of her career, Gardner has been proudly telling the Navy Pier story to millions of visitors and Chicagoans alike. She began her first role at the Pier in 1994 as the Assistant Director of Public Relations, during its first redevelopment effort, and has held a variety of positions over the years, including Director of Public Relations, Senior Director of Marketing and Communications, Executive Director of Marketing and finally General Manager of Navy Pier in 2006. During her more than 25-year tenure, Gardner’s impact has been significant on the Pier’s continued growth and evolution.<br /><br />A lifelong Chicagoan, Gardner is Vice Chair of Choose Chicago, Executive Committee member of the Chicago Sports Commission, a member of the Regional Board of the American Ireland Fund and serves on the Board of CURE Epilepsy. She attended St. Ignatius College Prep on the near west side of Chicago, where she Chairs the Mission & Academic Committee of its Board of Directors. Gardner received her Bachelor of Arts in Journalism from Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wis. and currently serves on the school’s National Alumni Board and as a mentor in the Alumni Mentorship Program.<br /><br />When she’s not found strolling her six-city-block Pier to ensure Chicagoans and families visiting from around the globe are enjoying their time, Marilynn is spending quality time in the North Center neighborhood with her own busy family including husband Patrick and children Madeline, Katherine and Patrick.</p>
