Throughout this process, Desmond led highly demanding employee experience and organizational processes with ease and employee satisfaction.  These accomplishments, combined with legacy Morningstar programs that Desmond helped pioneer – such trust based employment policies and the firm’s sabbatical policy – have made Morningstar a workplace that&#39;s been widely awarded and recognized.  Bevin was one of three employees who started the company&#39;s international business in the late 1990s. In the last 10 years alone, firm revenue from outside the United States has more than doubled. Desmond is credited with developing a truly global business in 27 countries that ensured Morningstar’s successful growth from $150 million to a thriving $1 billion+ organization today. From acquiring business to building teams from scratch, Bevin led more than 30 acquisitions and countless organizational development efforts to architect Morningstar’s business outside the US.  Desmond has been in an executive role at Morningstar for nearly 20 years. As president of international operations and head of global markets, she has helped transform the firm from a U.S. business to a global research powerhouse.  Under Desmond&#39;s leadership, Morningstar was named to Bloomberg’s Gender-Equality Index for the second consecutive year in 2020. Nearly 40% of Morningstar&#39;s workforce is female; at the senior level, 25% of Morningstar&#39;s executives/senior directors are female (compared to the industry average of 21.9%).',

		bio: 'Gayla Brockman moved to Chicago in 2016 to become the third President and CEO of the Michael Reese Health Trust. In just two years she orchestrated the transition of Michael Reese into a publicly supported foundation. As a public foundation, Michael Reese is able to leverage its assets, knowledge of industry and community and relationships to create the best possible environment for community based organizations and their programs. Whether it be creating a risk-free laboratory in which to prove concepts, incubating efforts that have proven successful in other communities or helping to accelerate promising practices, funders have a role to play to support the success of organizations and programs that align with mission. Previously, Ms. Brockman served as the Executive Director of the Menorah Legacy Foundation, a health care funder and program incubator, in Kansas City, Missouri from 2003 to 2015. Gayla is a co-founder of the Kansas City Double Up Food Bucks Kansas City, which makes fresh, locally grown food accessible and affordable to low-income residents. Prior to her foundation work, Ms. Brockman lived in Boston and worked in employee health at Boston’s Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and at Tufts Health Plan. She has a BA degree from the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor, MI and a MS degree in Health Care Administration from Simmons College in Boston, MA.

Ms. Brockman practices yoga, runs and plays tennis.  Accomplished, high energy, innovative health care foundation executive.

		bio: 'Melissa Conyears-Ervin is the current City Treasurer of the City of Chicago. In 2019, she made history by being the first female elected to the Office of Treasurer for the City of Chicago who was not previously appointed.  She is a former State Representative for the 10th District who believes in the promise of opportunity and the strength of families to effectively address the needs of our communities.  Before being elected as a State Representative, she gained more than 15-years of experience in the insurance industry as an executive for Allstate and CS Insurance Strategies, gaining insight into the challenges in the diverse and vibrant City of Chicago.  As City Treasurer, she is the only city-wide elected official sitting on all four pension boards and has utilized her private-sector and financial experience to increase economic development in Chicago’s neighborhoods by raising awareness of systemic issues that result in racial inequities. Under her leadership, the Advancing Equity in Banking Commission (AEBC) was formed to advance equity and eliminate systemic racism in the banking industry through equitable hiring, lending, and investment in Black communities. She believes that Chicago’s nearly $10 billion-dollar portfolio should be leveraged to help Chicago communities grow at the same economic rate, regardless of their zip code.  The Treasurer also developed a year-long program, Hope Inside, to help people increase their credit scores. It offers credit and money management resources to Chicagoans—FOR FREE. It offers workshops that teach Chicagoans to create a budget, understand and fix errors on their credit reports, and start planning for homeownership. In the credit Coaching Sessions, a FREE one-on-one session with a counselor, you can make plans for getting out of debt and raising your credit score. With this partnership, we launched the 700 Credit Score Initiative, where residents have the opportunity to receive 18 months of continuous counseling that can raise their credit scores by 120 points—it&#39;s free to all Chicago residents.  The Treasurer and her office have developed many programs to assist the residents of Chicago to help make their lives better.  # The Treasurer lives in Garfield Park with her husband Jason and daughter Jeneva. She is a proud member of Sigma Gamma Rho Sorority, Inc.',

		bio: 'Dr. Paula Allen-Meares’ roles as Chancellor of the University of Illinois at Chicago (UIC) and Dean of the schools of social work at University of Michigan (U-M) and University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign have provided her with significant experience in financial stewardship, labor relations, and workforce diversification. An international expert on educational access and success, human services in educational settings, and physical and mental health in under-resourced communities, Dr. Allen-Meares has published numerous articles and books, and her counsel has been sought by nonprofit boards, the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, the states of Illinois and Michigan, and the Obama and Trump administrations. She was elected to the National Academy of Medicine and holds a level-one Professional Director Certification from the American College of Corporate Directors.  Dr. Allen-Meares served as Chancellor at UIC, the largest public research university in Chicago, from 2009 to 2015; in 2010, she was also appointed Vice President of the University of Illinois. She oversaw a budget of $2 billion, 15 academic units, and over 28,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff. On the heels of the Great Recession, she led “Brilliant Futures&amp;#58; The Campaign for the University of Illinois at Chicago” to raise $676 million, the most ever raised by UIC, that went toward increasing access to academic opportunity through financial aid; accelerating the discovery and dissemination of knowledge; enriching the student experience; and promoting healthy societies in Chicago and internationally. This was her third major fundraising campaign as a higher education administrator, all of which exceeded their goals.  At UIC, which includes UI Health, Dr. Allen-Meares oversaw a workforce comprising more than 25 labor unions and negotiated a new faculty contract that is regarded as one of the best in the nation for upholding academic excellence while balancing financial necessities. She also introduced new revenue streams and cluster hiring for diversifying a staff that included more than 20 percent veterans and visually impaired individuals. In collaboration with the Board of Trustees, Dr. Allen-Meares launched “Access to Excellence and Success,” a major initiative to improve student access, retention, and graduation rates, which increased retention of Black students by nearly 10 percent, eliminated the retention gap between Black and white students, and led to UIC being designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the Department of Education. She was called on by the Obama administration to participate in a series of White House conferences on student success and college affordability. She also worked with federal authorities to mitigate potential threats that could have emerged from the UIC campus, receiving one of the highest national security clearances by the U.S. Department of Defense.  In 1993, Dr. Allen-Meares was appointed Dean of the U-M School of Social Work, ranked No. 1 in the country for nearly a decade. While she was Dean, the School’s endowment grew from $1 million to $43 million, and externally funded research awards reached more than $100 million.
