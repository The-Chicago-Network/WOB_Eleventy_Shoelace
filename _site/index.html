She oversaw a budget of $2 billion, 15 academic units, and over 28,000 students and 15,000 faculty and staff. On the heels of the Great Recession, she led “Brilliant Futures&amp;#58; The Campaign for the University of Illinois at Chicago” to raise $676 million, the most ever raised by UIC, that went toward increasing access to academic opportunity through financial aid; accelerating the discovery and dissemination of knowledge; enriching the student experience; and promoting healthy societies in Chicago and internationally. This was her third major fundraising campaign as a higher education administrator, all of which exceeded their goals.  At UIC, which includes UI Health, Dr. Allen-Meares oversaw a workforce comprising more than 25 labor unions and negotiated a new faculty contract that is regarded as one of the best in the nation for upholding academic excellence while balancing financial necessities. She also introduced new revenue streams and cluster hiring for diversifying a staff that included more than 20 percent veterans and visually impaired individuals. In collaboration with the Board of Trustees, Dr. Allen-Meares launched “Access to Excellence and Success,” a major initiative to improve student access, retention, and graduation rates, which increased retention of Black students by nearly 10 percent, eliminated the retention gap between Black and white students, and led to UIC being designated a Hispanic-Serving Institution by the Department of Education. She was called on by the Obama administration to participate in a series of White House conferences on student success and college affordability. She also worked with federal authorities to mitigate potential threats that could have emerged from the UIC campus, receiving one of the highest national security clearances by the U.S. Department of Defense.  In 1993, Dr. Allen-Meares was appointed Dean of the U-M School of Social Work, ranked No. 1 in the country for nearly a decade. While she was Dean, the School’s endowment grew from $1 million to $43 million, and externally funded research awards reached more than $100 million. She led the initiative to relocate the program into a state-of-the-art facility on the U-M campus, including fundraising and construction; engaged new major donors, including philanthropist Ann Lurie and Harpo Studios co-founder Jeff Jacobs; and created new endowed chairs and student scholarships. She chaired the University Health Sciences Council and was a founding dean of the Institute for Research on Women and Gender Advisory Committee, the National Center for Institutional Diversity, and the U-M Detroit Center.  From 1999 to 2008, Dr. Allen-Meares was a Trustee of the William T. Grant Foundation and served on the Nomination Committee (Chair) and the Research Committee. She was a New York Academy of Medicine Trustee and remains a Fellow, where she worked with other board members and then-mayor Michael Bloomberg on strategies to make New York City more livable for aging residents. She also served on the CEOs for Cities National Leadership Council. Elected to the National Academy of Medicine in 2005, she was appointed Chair of Section X in 2009 and then co-chaired Section X for another two years. She served on the NAM Sarnat Prize Committee and the NAM Awards Committee and currently serves on the Health Division Committee. She is also a member of the Royal Society of Medicine (UK).  Dr. Allen-Meares is a member of the Chicago Network and serves on the Chicago Civic Consulting Alliance Board and the Council of Economic Advisors for the President of Cook County in Chicago; she recently served on the American Council on Education’s Commission on Inclusion and the Executive Committee for the Coalition for Urban Serving Universities. She has also served as elected President of the Society of Social Work and Research and has advised such universities as Washington University, Saint Louis University, University of Pittsburg, and University of Southern California.  Dr. Allen-Meares is author or co-author of more than 170 publications and serves on the editorial boards of several scholarly journals and publications. Her research interests include the functions of human service providers in educational settings and the challenges and strengths of diverse communities. Major themes in her research include improving the physical and mental health of underprivileged children and adolescents of color and the strengths of parents and communities. Her research is cited around the world, and her theoretical model on school social work for at-risk youth has been used in South Africa, South Korea, Australia, China, and Europe. Her project work has been funded by the National Institutes of Mental Health, the National Institute on Minority Health Disparities, the National Institute of General Medical Sciences, the W.K. Kellogg Foundation, and the Skillman Foundation.',

She is a former State Representative for the 10th District who believes in the promise of opportunity and the strength of families to effectively address the needs of our communities.   Before being elected as a State Representative, she gained more than 15-years of experience in the insurance industry as an executive for Allstate and CS Insurance Strategies, gaining insight into the challenges in the diverse and vibrant City of Chicago.   As City Treasurer, she is the only city-wide elected official sitting on all four pension boards and has utilized her private-sector and financial experience to increase economic development in Chicago’s neighborhoods by raising awareness of systemic issues that result in racial inequities. Under her leadership, the Advancing Equity in Banking Commission (AEBC) was formed to advance equity and eliminate systemic racism in the banking industry through equitable hiring, lending, and investment in Black communities. She believes that Chicago’s nearly $10 billion-dollar portfolio should be leveraged to help Chicago communities grow at the same economic rate, regardless of their zip code.   The Treasurer also developed a year-long program, Hope Inside, to help people increase their credit scores. It offers credit and money management resources to Chicagoans—FOR FREE. It offers workshops that teach Chicagoans to create a budget, understand and fix errors on their credit reports, and start planning for homeownership. In the credit Coaching Sessions, a FREE one-on-one session with a counselor, you can make plans for getting out of debt and raising your credit score. With this partnership, we launched the 700 Credit Score Initiative, where residents have the opportunity to receive 18 months of continuous counseling that can raise their credit scores by 120 points—it&#39;s free to all Chicago residents.   The Treasurer and her office have developed many programs to assist the residents of Chicago to help make their lives better.
